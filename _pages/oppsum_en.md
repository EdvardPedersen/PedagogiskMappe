## Background
When I teach, I am a tool for learning for the students. My task is to enable, enhance, and augment the process of knowledge acquisition for the students.

Practically, I'm focused on presenting interesting problems to the students, as well as tools that are appropriate for approaching these problems.

I prefer to limit the amount of lecturing as much as possible, to dedicate more time to problem-solving, discussion, and observing practical applications.

## Theory
My teaching is based on the following theory

## Way forward
My experience is that students hesitate to question the execution of my teaching, as well as approach me. I want to give the students a less intimidating avenue for providing feedback.

I have attempted to approach this problem in several ways; by having a course-specific chat channel on the Discord server of the student union of the departement of computer science, as well as streaming live on twitch during tuesday evenings.
